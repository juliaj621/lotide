# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @juliaj621/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@juliaj621/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

* `assertArraysEqual`: Compares actual and expected arrays and returns passed or failed.
* `assertEqual`: Compares expected and actual values.
* `assertObjectsEqual`: Compares actual and expected objects and returns passed or failed.
* `countLetters`: Counts the number of character occurances in a string.
* `countOnly`: Counts the number of times a string occurs in an array.
* `eqArrays`: Compares two arrays and returns a boolean if the arrays are the same/different.
* `eqObjects`: Compares two objects and returns a boolean if the object are the same/different.
* `findKey`: Takes an object and a callback. Scans the object and returns the first key for which the callback returns a truthy value.
* `findKeyByValue`: Takes in an object and a value. It scans the object and returns the first key with the given value.
* `flatten`: Takes an array within an array and creates a new array merging the two.
* `head`: Returns the first element of an array.
* `letterPositions`: Returns the index in which a letter occurs in a string within an array.
* `map`: Returns the first letter of each element in an array of strings.
* `middle`: Returns the middle value (of odd) or values (if even) in an array longer than two elements.
* `tail`: Removes the first element in an array and returns the remaining elements in a new array.
* `takeUntil`: Takes an array and a callback function. Returns a new array of items occuring until the point specified by the callback functions.
* `without`: Takes an array and items to remove. Returns a new array without the removed items.
